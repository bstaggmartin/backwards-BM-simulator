\title{Extract posterior distributions from a fitted correlated rates Brownian Motion model}
\usage{
fit \%chains\% select
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class 'corateBM_fit', which is the typical output of a call to
\code{fit.corateBM}.}

\item{select}{A character or numeric vector. If of class character, the given text is matched to
parameter names using regular expressions. If of class numeric, the numbers are matched to indices
of rate parameters (\code{R_i}), include root (\code{R_0}). Exhibits special behavior with regards to
rate deviation (\code{R_i_dev}) and commas (','); see details below.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector, matrix, or 3D array. The dimensions will always go in the order of iterations,
then parameters, then chains, collapsing any dimensions of length 1. When \code{select} matches to a
single parameter, the parameter name is stored as an attribute labelled "parameters".
}
\description{
This is an operator for efficiently extracting sampled parameter values for particular parameters
from output of the function \code{fit.corateBM}.
}
\details{
These operators become really useful with some knowledge on how to use regular expressions.
Please consult Rstudio's
\href{https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf}{Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet}
to learn more about regular expressions.

For convenience, when faced with text including a single comma (','), this operator will attempt to
switch the text preceding the comma with any text comeing after the comma and before an underscore
('_'). In practice, this helps extract parameters related to covariance matrices, as
'trait1,trait2_evocov' is automatically converted to 'trait2,trait1_evocov'. This is helpful because
corateBM model outputs only store values for the lower triangle of the covariance matrix, since they are
symmetric. Can return unpredictable results in cases where ',' or '_' are part of trait names or
tip labels. Use double-backslashes ('\\,'/'\\_') to indicate 'escaped' commas and underscores that the
function should ignore during this swapping behavior. Note that you can also use '\\,' to do encode
expression searches of the form '{m,n}'.

Since rate deviation parameters are oftentimes redundant with rate parameters, parameter names ending in
'_dev' are by default excluded unless text with 'dev' is explicitly included at the end of a text
element the select argument.

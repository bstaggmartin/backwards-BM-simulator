\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree of class 'phylo'; function does not yet support multiple phylogenies
but will handle polytomous trees just fine.}

\item{Y}{A vector of trait data, with each element labelled according to its corresponding tip label.}

\item{R0.prior}{The standard deviation of the cauchy prior for the \code{R0} parameter determining
the rate of trait evolution at the root.}

\item{Rsig2.prior}{The standard deviation of the cauchy prior for the \code{Rsig2} parameter
determining the rate at which rate variance accumulates over time (inversely related to phylogenetic
autocorrelation of rates).}

\item{X0.prior}{The standard deviation of the cauchy prior for the \code{X0} parameter determining
the trait value at the root.}

\item{intra.var}{TRUE or FALSE value: should tip means be estimated with an error term or fixed
according to the data?}

\item{Ysig2.prior}{The standard deviation of the cauchy prior for the \code{Ysig2} parameter
determining the variance of observed trait values due to both intraspecific variation and/or
measurement error. Only matters when \code{intra.var} is set to TRUE.}

\item{trend}{TRUE or FALSE value: should the model fit an overall temporal trend to rates, as in an
early burst or accelarating rates model?}

\item{Rmu.prior}{The standard deviation of the cauchy prior for the \code{Rmu} parameter determining
the rate at which rates of trait evolution increase or decrease over time. Only matters when
\code{trend} is set to TRUE.}

\item{constrain.Rsig2}{TRUE or FALSE value: should the model constrain Rsig2 to be 0, reducing the
model to either a plain single-rate Brownian motion model (if \code{trend} is set to FALSE) or a
early burst or accelarating rates model (if \code{trend} is set to TRUE)?}

\item{report.quantiles}{A vector of values between 0 and 1, telling the function which quantiles of
of the marginal posterior distributions for each parameter to calculate. Use this to extract
'credible intervals' for parameter values. Set to NULL if no quantiles are desired.}

\item{report.means}{TRUE or FALSE value: should the function calculate mean posterior parameter
estimates?}

\item{report.devs}{TRUE or FALSE value: should the function calculate differences between average
branch-wise rates and the 'background rate' (see below)?}

\item{...}{Extra arguments to pass to the Stan's mcmc sampler. Use \code{chains} to set the number
of chains to run (4 by default), \code{iter} for the number of iterations (2000 by default),
\code{warmup} for the number of iterations devoted to the warmup period (\code{iter/2} by default),
\code{thin} to set the thinning rate (1 by default), and \code{refresh} to set the frequency of
reporting in the R console (\code{iter/10} by default). See \code{rstan::sampling} for more options.}
}
\value{
A list of class 'corateBM_fit', containing an array 'chains', with rows corresponding to
iterations in the mcmc sampler and columns to parameters. The array is 3D, with each
matrix slice corresponding to a particular mcmc chain. Parameters may include \code{R0}, \code{Rsig2},
\code{X0}, \code{Ysig2}, and \code{Rmu}, as defined above. Average branch-wise rates are also included
and denoted
\code{R[i]} where \code{i} is the index of the edge as given in \code{tree}. If \code{intra.var} is
set to TRUE, the array will also include the tip mean parameters, denoted by their tip labels as given
in \code{tree}. Additionally, the function calculates the posterior distribution of 'background rates'
by taking the average of all average branch-wise rate parameters, weighted by the relative lengths of 
their respective branches, denoted \code{bg.rate}.

Optionally, the object may contain additional arrays including 'quantiles', 'means', and 'post.probs'.
'quantiles' is an array formatted similarly to 'chains' with rows corresponding to quantiles of the
marginal posterior distributions of parameters. 'means' is a matrix of mean posterior parameter
estimates with rows corresponding to parameters and columns to separate mcmc chains. If 
\code{report.devs} is set to TRUE, the function additionally calculates the posterior distributions of
differences between each average branch-wise rate parameter and the background rate ('rate
deviations', denoted \code{R[i] dev}), and creates a matrix, 'post.probs', of posterior probabilities
that each branch-wise rate deviation is greater than 0. These can be interpreted as the probability
that a given branch in the phylogeny exhibits an anomalously high rate of trait evolution (note that
low probabilities indicate anomalously low rates). Quantiles and mean posterior estimates will also be
calculated for rate deviation parameters, if applicable.

\description{
This function processes tree and trait data and fits an autocorrelated rates Brownian motion model to
it using a Stan-based mcmc sampler. Under an autocorrelated rates Brownian motion model, the rates at
trait evolution themselves evolve according to a Brownian motion process, allowing rates of
evolution to vary across the tree in a phylogenetically autocorrelated manner. The results are
formatted into a (relatively) user-friendly list of arrays for further analysis and diagnostics.

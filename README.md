# backwards-BM-simulator
A set of R functions, classes, and methods designed to simulate BM evolution backwards in time along a given phylogeny while holding observed trait values constant.

So far, I have developed a function for simulating BM by adding normally-distributed noise to the ML estimates of ancestral states ('simBM'). I am still revisiting this approach, since it tends to produce 'overly-optimized' trait evolution trajectories; there might be a way to penalize ML estimate precision based on the number of nodes with observed trait values descending from a particular node. There is also a function for thresholding BM simulations to transform them into multiSimmap objects ('thresh'), which are compatible with fitting multi-rate BM models in the package 'mvmorph'. Lastly, I have implemented an MCMC algorithm to explore branch-wise variation in evolutionary rates using an autocorrelated clock model ('relaxed.clock.BM')--the output of this algorithm will be used in the future to squash and stretch branches when simulating BM, relaxing the assumption of a constant rate of evolution across the tree.

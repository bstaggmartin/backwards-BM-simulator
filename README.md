# contSimmap
R package currently best-suited for fitting various 'relaxed clock models' to continuous trait data and phylogenetic trees, allowing intraspecific variation and measurement error. Does not yet allow mulivariate traits or missing data, but these are both planned for future updates. Has the bare bones to also do stochastic character mapping for continuous traits, but this is old and in dire need of an overhaul once again planned for future updates. The ultimate goal is to allow for simulation of probable continuous trait evolutionary trajectories while accounting for uncertaintly and heterogeneity in evolutionary rates.

# evorates
R package implementing methods for fitting "relaxed" models of continuous trait evolution to comparative data (i.e., a phylogeny and associated trait data), whereby the rate of trait evolution itself gradually changes over time and across lineages. Provides additional tools for simulating data, as well as manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing estimated model parameters. For more information see the [associated publication](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syac068/6830631).

The package is not available on CRAN but can be installed from github using the devtools package with the following line of code: ```devtools::install_github("https://github.com/bstaggmartin/evorates")```. Note that you will need to install Rtools for this!

This package has all the basic features to do your own analyses. However, I'm still working on a few convenience features and bits of documentation here and there. If you run into any issues, please post it or reach out to me at bruce.stagg.martin@gmail.com for further assistance. I would be happy to help!

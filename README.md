# contSimmap
R package currently best-suited for fitting "correlated rates Brownian Motion" (corateBM) models to continuous trait data and phylogenetic trees, accomodating intraspecific variation/measurement error, missing data, and mutlivariate traits. It allows you to explore variation in apparent rates of trait evolution across a phylogenetic tree. If you somehow find yourself here, please note that this is all a heavy work in progress, and that many of the functions here are undocumented, untested, or even completely depreciated. Reach out to me at: bruce.stagg.martin@gmail.com if you're interested in using any of this, and I will help guide you in the right direction.

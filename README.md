# evorates
R package implementing methods for fitting "relaxed" models of continuous trait evolution to comparative data (i.e., a phylogeny and associated trait data), whereby the rate of trait evolution itself gradually changes over time and across lineages. Provides additional tools for simulating data, as well as manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing estimated model parameters.

This package has all the basic features to do your own analyses. However, many convenience features and--most critically--documentation are still a work in progress or outdated. You may run into the occassional bug too. If you want to use the package, reach out to bruce.stagg.martin@gmail.com for further assistance. I would be happy to help!
